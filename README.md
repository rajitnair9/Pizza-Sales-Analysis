# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
We harnessed the power of Microsoft SQL Server for the initial analysis and then further validated the findings by replicating the process within Power BI. This rigorous approach ensured the accuracy and reliability of the insights derived from the data.

The outcome was two distinct dashboards, each serving a unique purpose:
ðŸ“Š Dashboard 1: A thorough exploration of key performance indicators (KPIs) pertaining to pizza sales, validated through both SQL and Power BI analyses.
ðŸ“Š Dashboard 2: An examination of the best and worst-selling pizza varieties, based on the historical sales data, and reaffirmed through double validation.
This project was a significant learning experience, reinforcing the importance of data analysis, SQL, and Power BI as tools to drive data-driven decision-making.
